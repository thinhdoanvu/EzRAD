This instruction for relatednees detection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Step 1. Download relatedness_1.0.zip file to your machine
#Step 2. Start R studio
#Step 3. Click Menu Tools - Install packages - choose the path_you_saved_related_1.0.zip
#Step 4. Open Excel file which you import genepop file inside and used for converting to Alerquin or Genepop,etc... and follow this:
         4.1. Copy lines from 4th to the end (1-3 are headers, so we don't need to copy), and paste them in new SHEET
         4.2. Delete 2nd column (POP_ID column)
         4.3. Copy all to new text file (using Notepad++)
         4.4. Repace 0 by 000. Use this command 
              Press: Ctrl + H
              Search value: \t0\t
              Replace value: \t000\t
              Search value: \t
              Replace value:  (1 space)
              Replace 2 space by 1 space
              Because, we need to encode input file with 3-character code
         4.5. Save file with name: input.relatedness
#Step 5. Open R studio
#Step 6. Use this command first: require (related)
         Result are: 
          Loading required package: related
          Loading required package: tools
          Loading required package: ggplot2
          If you have problem with related require x32 R environment, Click Tools - Global Options - Change to 32 bits environment, restart R
#Step 7. input <- read.table("the_path_you_saved_relatedness file",header = FALSE, sep = " ", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
          Forexample: input <- read.table("/home/thinhdv/input.related",header = FALSE, sep = " ", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#Step 8. output <- coancestry (input, allow.inbreeding=TRUE, ci95.num.bootstrap =100, dyadml=2)
          We want to check relatedness with 95% confident and 50 replicate. If you want more you can choose higher value
          95% confident (xxx=2)
          50 replicate (bootstrap=50)
#Stepp 9. Read values
          output$relatedness
#Step 10. Write to EXCEL file
          write.csv(output$relatedness,file="the_path_you_want_to_save_out.related.csv")
#Step 11. Open output file in EXCEL and sort columns by Decrease ordered, and check values with >0.9. We will summary all individuals with this value and need be remove them out in next filtering step
