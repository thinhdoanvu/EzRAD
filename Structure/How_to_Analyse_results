Step 1. Clik the name of the Parameter for analysing.
-----1.1. For example, TutorialParameter_run_x(K=y). with x = 5, y = 2
-----1.2. Click BarPlot to show bar graph.
-------1.2.1. Choose Original Order. We can see that, there are 3 locations but there are 2 clusters with 2 different colors (GREE and RED)
-------1.2.2. Choose Group by POP ID. We can see that, the number 1, 2, 3 at the botom are POP ID as we defined before. 
              There are 2 clusters with 2 different colors (GREE and RED). Grop 1 RED color is dominate, Grop 2 GREEN color is dominate.
              Group 3 alsmost is RED color, a litle for GREEN.
-------1.2.3. Choose Sort by Q for crystal view how many groups for.
-------1.2.4. Choose Plot in multiple lines to know what are individuals for groups 1 or 2.
-------1.2.5. Click Save to download plot in to your path. But it is not good enough quality for report. 
              My advice is screen shot and save to your drive
              
Step 2. Clik the name of the Parameter for analysing.
-----2.1. For example, TutorialParameter_run_x(K=y). with x = 5, y = 2
-----2.2. Read Information
          --------------------------------------------
          Proportion of membership of each pre-defined
           population in each of the 2 clusters

          Given    Inferred Clusters       Number of
           Pop       1      2             Individuals

            1:     0.981  0.019              17
            2:     0.022  0.978              21
            3:     0.805  0.195              13
          --------------------------------------------
1st column: Populations (clusters): 1 2 3 4
2nd and 3rd column: Infer clusters, in this case I choose infer by 2, so I have 2 column 2 and 3. 
                    If I choose infer cluster by 3, I will have 3 column 2, 3, and 4
                    If I choose infer cluster by 4, I will have 4 column 2, 3, 4, and 5
                    And so on ...
       You can see, Pop 1: Cluster 1 proportioned with 98.1% and 1.90% for Cluster 2
                    Pop 2: Cluster 2 proportioned with 97.8% and 2.20% for Cluster 1
                    Pop 3: Cluster 1 proportioned with 80.5% and 19.5% for Cluster 2
4th column: Number of Individuals: How many individuals per each sample location.
