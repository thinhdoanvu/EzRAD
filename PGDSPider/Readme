----Data input file: 
------File format: choose VCF
------Select inputfile: the path to your folder which contain vcf file

----Data output file:
------File format: choose STRUCTURE

--------what is population looks like????? 
----------1st column: name of sample as same name as vcf file. For example
------------#CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO	FORMAT	HP_HP32	HP_HP45	HP_HP46	HP_HP47	HP_HP48	HP_HP50	HP_HP51.......
----------2nd column: increasing number of goups do you want to mark. For example, HP_HP32 is 1, KG_KG12 is 2 ....
########################population file####################
HP_HP32	1
HP_HP45	1
