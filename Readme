1. How to filter raw SNPs into validate SNPs
2. How many clusters in populations by 
  2.1. Structure
  2.2. PCA by R
  2.3. Fst and AMOVA in Alerquin
3. How to dect Outlier loci by 
  3.1. Lositan
  3.2. Bayescan
4. Detect Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Relatedness using EM Algorithm
5. Hardy-Weinberg (HWE) detecttion by GenAlEx
6. Remove Individuals with relatedness value >=0.9 (Wang,2007 and Milligan 2003)
7. Remove Divergent, Outlier, Balance loci => Neutral Loci for tets 2,5 again.
8. Keep only Divergent Loci, and use for test 2,5 again
9. Using Neutral data for Effected population size by NeEstimator
10. Using Neutral data for migration test

PangasiusLanaudi:
Sheet: hwe
You can see 
	the number of loci for analysis: 559
	the number of individuals: 43
	the number of sample sites: 2
	the number of sample per site: 27 and 16

AFP sheet (Don't attention)
out.related sheet
This sheet is use for imbreeding test, the related value would be from 0 to 1 and devide into 4 parts:
0.50-1.0 means for full sibling
0.25-0.50 means for half sibling
0.10-0.25 means for first cousin
>0-0.10 means for second cousin
=0 means for no related
So, that why I choose >0.8 for remove individuals, actually I can reomove more samples from 0.25.
How are the related values tell something? I think they relavant with aquaculture fish or populations with the same parents.

Outlier loci use for detect adaptation with environment of species. In this sheet, please check grap. You can see 3-color yellow, red and grey.
	Yellow indicates for balance loci which is adaptable for environment
	Grey indicates for stable loci
	Red indicates for long-time loci
In this sheet, please focus on FDR column. If this value mark OUTLIER, that means the locus will be change for adaptation.
We need to remove that loci (neutral loci remain)

HFP_neutral sheet
	These values indicate for Heterozygousity value. The population which higher values mean that pop higher diversity. Please check line 18-23th
	
Structure sheet
In this sheet you can see 2 colors (red and green). However, they mix togethers and seem to be 1 group.
What is the story?
2 sites may be come from 1 group. All of them share the same many genetic. Sheet Amova tell you more

AMOVA sheet
We assume that we have 1 group which include UB and MK mainstream. How is the different inside?
Among population is lower 0.5% and the different almost come from within group (>99%)

Fst sheet
Fst value shows how is the different populations. This value from 0 to 1 and devide into 4 parts:
Hartl and Clark (1997) had some classes for FST. 
<0.05 = little genetic diff.
0.05-0.15 = moderate genetic diff.
0.15-0.25 = great genetic diff.
>0.25 = very great genetic diff.
Frankham et al. (2002; 2010) had FST>0.15 = significant differentiation

In this sheet, the value below diagonal indicate the Fst value with 0.012. This means, 2 populations seem connect together with p-value significant 0.0001.

Ne sheet tells about healthy populations
If pop with lower 500 for Ne value that means this pop have real problem. Need to be conservation or No diversity.

PCA sheet
PCA graph show more related population clearly than structure. Please attention on the horizontal and vertical lines, they will tell you about the 
connect or disconnect populations.
