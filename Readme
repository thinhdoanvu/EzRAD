1. How to filter raw SNPs into validate SNPs
2. How many clusters in populations by 
  2.1. Structure
  2.2. PCA by R
  2.3. Fst and AMOVA in Alerquin
3. How to dect Outlier loci by 
  3.1. Lositan
  3.2. Bayescan
4. Detect Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Relatedness using EM Algorithm
5. Hardy-Weinberg (HWE) detecttion by GenAlEx
6. Remove Individuals with relatedness value >=0.9 (Wang,2007 and Milligan 2003)
7. Remove Divergent, Outlier, Balance loci => Neutral Loci for tets 2,5 again.
8. Keep only Divergent Loci, and use for test 2,5 again
9. Using Neutral data for Effected population size by NeEstimator
10. Using Neutral data for migration test
