What is the Holm-Bonferroni Method?
The Holm-Bonferroni Method (also called Holm’s Sequential Bonferroni Procedure) is a way to deal with familywise error rates (FWER) 
for multiple hypothesis tests. It is a modification of the Bonferroni correction. The Bonferroni correction reduces the possibility 
of getting a statistically significant result (i.e. a Type I error) when performing multiple tests. Although the Bonferroni is simple 
to calculate, it suffers from a lack of statistical power. The Holm-Bonferroni method is also fairly simple to calculate, 
but it is more powerful than the single-step Bonferroni.

Question: Use the Holm-Bonferroni method to test the following four hypotheses and their associated p-values at an alpha level of .05:
SORT by pvalue first
rank	pvalue
1	0.0001
2	0.0001
3	0.0001
4	0.0001
5	0.0001
6	0.0001
7	0.0001
8	0.0001
9	0.0001
10	0.0001
11	0.0001
12	0.0090
13	0.0090
14	0.0090
15	0.0180
16	0.0180
17	0.0360
18	0.0360
19	0.0360
20	0.0541
21	0.0631
22	0.1441
23	0.1532
24	0.1802
25	0.1982
26	0.2703
27	0.2793
28	0.3063
29	0.3063
30	0.3694
31	0.4414
32	0.4775
33	0.5586
34	0.5586
35	0.5856
36	0.7838

Step 2: Work the Holm-Bonferroni formula for the first rank:(FDR=0.05)
HB = Target α / (n – rank + 1)
HB = 0.05/(36 - 1 + 1) = 0.05/36 = 0.001388889
#EXCEL formula (O2 means 1st rank)
=0.05/(COUNTA($P$2:$P$37)-O2+1)

Step 3: Compare the first-ranked (smallest) p-value from Step 1 to the alpha level calculated in Step 2:
Smallest p-value, in Step 1 (p1 = 0.0001) < Alpha level in Step 2 (0.001388889).
If the p-value is smaller, reject the null hypothesis for this individual test.
The p-value of 0.0001 is less than 0.001388889, so the null hypothesis for p1 is rejected.

Step 4: Repeat the HB formula for the second rank .
HB = Target α / (n – rank + 1)
HB = .05 / (36 – 2 + 1) = .05 / 35 = .001428571
#EXCEL formula (O3 is 2nd rank
=0.05/(COUNTA($P$2:$P$37)-O3+1)

Step 5: Compare the result from the HB formula in Step 4 to the second-ranked p-value: 
Second ranked p-value, in Step 1 (p2 = .0001) < Alpha level in Step 2 (.001428571).
The p-value of .0001 is less than .001428571, so the null hypothesis for p2 is rejected as well.

Step k, k+1: repeat all steps
