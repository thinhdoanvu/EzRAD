Please, download Lositan from here because file is too large for upload to here: https://app.box.com/s/5k7ruxzzsppuj01ptbzquq7tz8ytlb27

#Step 1. Unzip folder lositan
#Step 2. Run file runLocal.bat if your are using Windows version (runLocal.sh for Linux)
#Step 3. Click Menu FILE - Open GenePop data - Choose the_path_you_saved_genepop file after convert from PGD Spider OR (the file you converted from GenAlex with .gen extension)
#Step 4. If you see Fst announcement for population, click OK to go next
#Step 5. CPU cores params, set default
         #of sims x1000, choose at least 50 to 5000 (depend your super computer)
         confident interval: 95% or 99%
         False Disc. rate: 0.05 or 0.01
#Step 6. Click RUN and wait for compeleting
#Step 7. When you finsish, please click window result. Press Ctrl + C - then open Excel - Ctrl + V for paste

#Step 8. Insert header line in EXCEL like this:
Loci	Het	Fst	pvalue	FDR	Balance	Divergent
For example:
Loci	Het	Fst	pvalue	FDR	Balance	Divergent
SNP_8	0.183333	0.446809	0.997041	--	
SNP_19	0.2	0.489362	0.995177	--	
SNP_26	0.158333	0.382979	0.99724	--	

#Step 9. Now, we will use some formulars in Excel
         9.1. For Balance coulumn, use this command in 2nd row 
              =D2<=0.05
              Explaination: D2 means column D, 2nd row. <= 0.05 means for less than or equal 0.05
              Result is TRUE or FALSE
         9.2. For Divergent column, use this command in 2nd row
              =ROUND(D2,3)>=0.98
              Explaination: D2 means column D, 2nd row. >= 0.98 means for greater than or equal 0.98.
              The ROUND function rounds a number to a specified number of digits. For example, if cell A1 contains 23.7825, and you want to round that value to two decimal places, you can use the following formula:=ROUND(A1, 2). The result of this function is 23.78.
         9.3. Select 1st row (header row), click menu DATA - Filter. You will see header row now can be select by value
              Click Balance cloumn and choose only TRUE value, then choose all rows inside, choose YELLOW color for that rows
              Then choose all value for this column
         9.4. Click Divergent cloumn and choose only TRUE value, then choose all rows inside, choose RED color for that rows
              Then choose all value for this column
         9.5. Click FDR column, choose OUTLIER value. That is all your OUTLIER, please select value in Loci column and paste in other sheet.
In this section, you can see that there are many outlier detect (yellow rows), but only rows with FDR <= 0.05 is real OUTLIER loci.
YELLOW color means for Balance selection
RED color measn for Divergent loci
GRIS color means for Neutral loci

#Step 1. Download file from this resposity and Unzip file to your folder
#Step 2. Convert VCF to GESTE/Bayescan by PGDSPIDER program. REMEMBER CHOOSE SNP FOR GESTE/BAYESCAN WRITER QUESTION
#Step 3. Open the path_you_unzip_Bayescan2.1 and Choose version compatable with your PC. I recommend you choose BayeScan2.1_win32bits_GUI.exe for Windows and you want to set default value for this programs
#Step 4. Choose the path file for input and output file 
#Step 5. Choose prefix name for output, beacuse you will have 4 - 5 files output with the same name. I choose output value.
#Step 6. If you want to set another value differ with default, please check Options tab (Not recommended). 
#Step 7. Clcik Start and wait until finish.
#Step 7. Find fst.txt suffix file name which use for R analysis 
#Step 8. Start R studio
         Copy and paste this command in R window: 
         first: source("the_path_of_BayeScan2.1/R functions/plot_R.r")
         second: plot_bayescan("the_path_of_fst.txt suffix file",FDR=0.05)
         If you have any OUTLIER LOCI, black line will be appear and you can see all of them on the right of this line

Explaination:

For the method of Beaumont and Nichols (1996), the program LOSITAN was used (Antao et al. 2008). This method identifies loci under selection 
based on the joint distributions of expected heterozygosity and FST. After removing a candidate subset of selected loci (outside the 95 % 
confidence interval) determined by an initial run with 100,000 simulations, the distribution of neutral FST (depicted by curves around the 
assessed loci) was computed using putatively neutral loci with 100,000 simulations and a bisection approximation algorithm (Antao et al. 2008). 
Outliers were identified by comparing observed distribution with neutral expectations at the 99 and 1 % confidence levels (FDR < 0.05). 
Loci outside the 99 and 5 % confidence areas were identified as candidates affected by positive (divergent) and balancing selection, respectively.
